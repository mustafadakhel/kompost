# Kompost: Gardening-Inspired Scoping and DI ðŸŒ±
Welcome to Kompost, the scoping and dependency injection library named while I was gardening. Have fun figuring out what everything means. This isn't a serious project, just something from my free time to make DI a bit more amusing.

## Features

- **Application Scope**: Dependencies available to all other scopes within the application.
- **Activity Scope**: Dependencies tied to the lifecycle of an activity.
- **Fragment Scope**: Dependencies tied to the lifecycle of a fragment.
- **ViewModel Scope**: Manage ViewModels with or without `SavedStateHandle`.
- **Custom Scopes**: Flexible scopes to meet specific application needs.

## Quick Start

Planting your first seed is easy! Just follow the steps below and watch your dependencies sprout.

### Step 1: Add Kompost to Your Project

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Core
    implementation("com.mustafadakhel.kompost:kompost-core:1.1.0")

    // Android application support 
    implementation("com.mustafadakhel.kompost:kompost-android:1.1.0")

    // Lifecycle support
    implementation("com.mustafadakhel.kompost:kompost-lifecycle:1.1.0")
}
```

### Step 2: Create Your Application Farm

```kotlin
class KompostSampleApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        kompostSampleApplicationFarm()
    }
}

private fun Application.kompostSampleApplicationFarm() = createApplicationFarm {
    // Application-wide dependencies
    produce { DependencyAvailableApplicationWide() }
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Activity and Fragment Farms

```kotlin
fun ApplicationFarm.activities() = createActivitiesFarm {
    // Activities dependencies
    produce { ActivityRepository(supply()) }
}

fun ComponentActivity.setupFragmentScopedFarm() = getOrCreateActivityScopedFarm {
    produceFragmentScopedFarm {
        // Fragment-scoped dependencies
        produce { FragmentRepository(supply()) }
    }
}
```

## Scopes of Dependency Injection

Kompost supports various scopes to ensure your dependencies grow where theyâ€™re needed.

### Application Scope

Dependencies available to all other scopes within the application.

```kotlin
private fun Application.kompostSampleApplicationFarm() = createApplicationFarm {
    singleton(dependency = Database())
}
```

### Activity Scope

Dependencies tied to the lifecycle of an activity.

```kotlin
fun ApplicationFarm.activities() = createActivitiesFarm {
    produce { ActivityRepository(supply()) }
}
```

### Fragment Scope

Dependencies tied to the lifecycle of a fragment.

```kotlin
fun ComponentActivity.setupFragmentScopedFarm() = getOrCreateActivityScopedFarm {
    produceFragmentScopedFarm {
        produce { FragmentRepository(supply()) }
    }
}
```

### ViewModel Scope

ViewModels with and without `SavedStateHandle`.

```kotlin
fun RootActivitiesFarm.viewModels() = createViewModelsFarm {
    produce { MainViewModel(supply()) }
    produceViewModelWithSavedState { savedStateHandle ->
        MainViewModelWithSavedStateHandle(supply(), savedStateHandle)
    }
}
```

### Custom Scopes

Kompost allows you to create custom scopes tailored to your application's specific needs.

```kotlin
class CustomScopeFarm : Producer {
    // Custom scope implementation
}

fun Application.createCustomScopeFarm() {
    val customScopeFarm = CustomScopeFarm()
    // Custom scope setup
}
```

## Scope Hierarchy

Hereâ€™s a text diagram to show you how all these scopes stack up:

```
Application Scope
â””â”€â”€ Activity Scope
    â”œâ”€â”€ Fragment Scope
    â””â”€â”€ ViewModel Scope (Activity)
         â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModel without SavedStateHandle
         â””â”€â”€ ViewModel with SavedStateHandle
```
